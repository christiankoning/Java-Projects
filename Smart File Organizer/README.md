## Smart File Organizer 📂
A CLI-based file organizer that automatically sorts files based on **type, creation date, or user-defined rules**. <br>
This project will later expand into a **GUI version** using JavaFX.

### 📌 Features Implemented
- ✅ **File Type Sorting:** Automatically moves files into categorized folders (`Images`, `Documents`, etc.).  
- ✅ **Date-Based Organization:** Sorts files into subfolders by modification/creation date (`2025-03`).

## 🔹 Future Enhancements

- **User-Defined Rules:** Custom rules for file organization (e.g., regex-based naming patterns).
- **Duplicate File Detection:** Identifies duplicate files and offers options (delete, rename, move).
- **Logging & Reports:** Generates logs of all actions performed.
- **File Preview Feature (GUI):** Allows users to preview files before moving them.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality (GUI):** Users can drop folders/files into the application for processing.
- **Undo Functionality:** In case files are moved incorrectly, allow users to revert actions.
- **Multi-threaded Performance Optimization:** Faster processing for large directories.
